a digital garden is a place to build & learn in public.The goal is to reduce friction taken to publish a note,so that as I learn, you can learn with me.


The notes are meant to be interconnected with one another, so a reader can follow along a train of thought and gather insights about ...whatever it's i'm writing about.
